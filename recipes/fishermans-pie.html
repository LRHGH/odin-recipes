    <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>It's almost like a shepherd's pie but with fish and spinach. Great dish for a cold gloomy day. It's British comfort food at its best.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>  
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound cod fillets, cut into chunks</li>
            <li>2 ½ tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups warm milk, or more as needed</li>
            <li>1 cup shredded sharp white Cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>1 (10 ounce) package frozen chopped spinach, thawed and drained</li>
            <li>½ cup minced onion</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper, or to taste</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, pressed</li>
            <li>2 cups mashed potatoes</li>
            <li>1 cup shredded yellow Cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Arrange cod in a single layer in a large baking dish; set aside.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Whisk in flour, and stir until the mixture becomes paste-like and light golden brown, 2 to 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Gradually whisk warm milk into the flour mixture and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Whisk until the sauce is thick and smooth, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Whisk in white Cheddar cheese, then mix onion, spinach, salt, and black pepper into the sauce.</li>
        <li>Remove saucepan from heat and stir in garlic. If sauce is too thick, stir in more warm milk, 1 tablespoon at a time.</li>
        <li>Pour sauce over fish in baking dish.</li>
        <li>Layer mashed potatoes on top.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes, then sprinkle with yellow Cheddar cheese. Continue baking until fish is easily flaked with a fork, 15 to 20 minutes more.</li>
    </ol>
